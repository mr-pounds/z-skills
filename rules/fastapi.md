You are an expert in Python, FastAPI, and scalable API development.

## Key Principles

- Write concise, technical responses with accurate Python examples.
- Use functional, declarative programming; avoid classes where possible.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., is_active, has_permission).
- Use lowercase with underscores for directories and files (e.g., routers/user_routes.Py).
- Favor named exports for routes and utility functions.
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

## Python/FastAPI

- Use def for pure functions and async def for asynchronous operations.
- Use type hints for all function signatures. Prefer Pydantic models over raw dictionaries for input validation.
- File structure: exported router, sub-routes, utilities, static content, types (models, schemas).
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
- For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
- Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if condition: do_something()).

## Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases:
  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements.
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability.
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use the if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Use custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.

## Package Management with `uv`

These rules define strict guidelines for managing Python dependencies in this project using the `uv` dependency manager.

**✅ Use `uv` exclusively**
- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.

**🔁 Managing Dependencies**
Always use these commands:

```bash
# Add or upgrade dependencies
uv add <package>

# Remove dependencies
uv remove <package>

# Reinstall all dependencies from lock file
uv sync
```

**🔁 Scripts**

```bash
# Run script with proper dependencies
uv run script.py
```

You can edit inline-metadata manually:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "torch",
#     "torchvision",
#     "opencv-python",
#     "numpy",
#     "matplotlib",
#     "Pillow",
#     "timm",
# ]
# ///

print("some python code")
```

Or using uv cli:

```bash
# Add or upgrade script dependencies
uv add package-name --script script.py

# Remove script dependencies
uv remove package-name --script script.py

# Reinstall all script dependencies from lock file
uv sync --script script.py
```

## FastAPI-Specific Guidelines

- Use functional components (plain functions) and Pydantic models for input validation and response schemas.
- Use declarative route definitions with clear return type annotations.
- Use def for synchronous operations and async def for asynchronous ones.
- Minimize @app.On_event("startup") and @app.On_event("shutdown"); prefer lifespan context managers for managing startup and shutdown events.
- Use middleware for logging, error monitoring, and performance optimization.
- Optimize for performance using async functions for I/O-bound tasks, caching strategies, and lazy loading.
- Use HTTPException for expected errors and model them as specific HTTP responses.
- Use middleware for handling unexpected errors, logging, and error monitoring.
- Use Pydantic's BaseModel for consistent input/output validation and response schemas.

## Performance Optimization

- Minimize blocking I/O operations; use asynchronous operations for all database calls and external API requests.
- Implement caching for static and frequently accessed data using tools like Redis or in-memory stores.
- Optimize data serialization and deserialization with Pydantic.
- Use lazy loading techniques for large datasets and substantial API responses.

## Testing and Debugging

- Always write unit tests for functions using testing frameworks like `pytest`.
- Ensure correctness of mathematical computations and transformations.
- test function can implement client、db to get client or database session。

```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlalchemy.orm import Session

def test_create_user(client: TestClient, db: Session) -> None:
    r = client.post(
        f"{settings.API_V1_STR}/private/users/",
        json={
            "email": "pollo@listo.com",
            "password": "password123",
            "full_name": "Pollo Listo",
        },
    )

    assert r.status_code == 200

    data = r.json()

    user = db.exec(select(User).where(User.id == uuid.UUID(data["id"]))).first()

    assert user
    assert user.email == "pollo@listo.com"
    assert user.full_name == "Pollo Listo"
```

## Git Workflow

### Commit Message Format

```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: Attribution disabled globally via ~/.claude/settings.json.

### Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

### Feature Implementation Workflow

1. **Plan First**
   - Use **planner** agent to create implementation plan
   - Identify dependencies and risks
   - Break down into phases

2. **TDD Approach**
   - Use **tdd-guide** agent
   - Write tests first (RED)
   - Implement to pass tests (GREEN)
   - Refactor (IMPROVE)
   - Verify 80%+ coverage

3. **Code Review**
   - Use **code-reviewer** agent immediately after writing code
   - Address CRITICAL and HIGH issues
   - Fix MEDIUM issues when possible

4. **Commit & Push**
   - Detailed commit messages
   - Follow conventional commits format



## Key Conventions

1. Rely on FastAPI’s dependency injection system for managing state and shared resources.
2. Prioritize API performance metrics (response time, latency, throughput).
3. Limit blocking operations in routes:
   - Favor asynchronous and non-blocking flows.
   - Use dedicated async functions for database and external API operations.
   - Structure routes and dependencies clearly to optimize readability and maintainability.

Refer to FastAPI documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.
